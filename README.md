# web-table-w-fixed-first-last
A table template for displaying large sheets of data. With fixed first and last row (headers and footers) as well as the first column. This whole functionality is achieved with HTML/CSS only. JS is used just for filling the table with "lorem ipsum" data-filler. Styles are separated by their purpose.
